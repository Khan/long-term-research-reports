            When we think about manipulating numbers, some operations seem easy
            or obvious, and others exotic and abstract. Addition and
            multiplication by tens? Straightforward. Modular arithmetic and
            changes of base? Not exactly obvious.

            attempt just that.

            We build our fluency with numbers incrementally from many angles. We
            might think of “seven” as being three away from ten… or as being two
            more than five… or as being almost double four. When viewed across
            numbers, these relationships can become first-class ideas of their
            own that apply to any number, like “distance to the nearest ten.”

            Different representations of numbers emphasize or obscure different
            number meanings. For example, the base-ten representation of 12
            makes a “10 + 2” decomposition natural. But the two arrangements of
            twelve circles depicted here make us think of “12 = 3 x 4” or “12 =
            4 x 3”.

            With improved representations, certain thoughts become easier to
            think. By improving our representations, we can make powerful ideas
            more broadly accessible—or even accessible at all! Before the
            Mesopotamian base-60 number system circa 3400 BC, humans represented
            numbers using tallies or tokens. Imagine trying to think about the
            number 1,776 if you only had tick marks!

          While it’s true that most people in math class don’t learn much math,
          most kids in French class don’t learn much French. But, we don’t say
          that they are not “French-ly minded.” We don’t say that they don’t
          have a head for French because we know that if they grew up in France,
          they would learn French perfectly well. And I think that my image of
          learning mathematics is that if we all learned mathematics in
          “Mathland,” we would all learn mathematics perfectly well.

            Students have long used physical manipulatives like these plastic
            blocks to represent numbers. Manipulatives can be
            powerful—particularly because they take advantage of our
            body-awareness—but physical objects are limited by
            often-inconvenient laws of physics and practicalities of matter.

            maintain relationships between multiple representations. They can
            create a new expressive context for social interaction. And they can
            more easily encode elements of expert guidance in their interactions

            inherent property of digital objects, but plastic blocks need

            If we add recordings as a first-class element of Cantor’s canvas, we
            don’t have to play them back like a non-interactive video:
            recordings can be <em>integrated into the interactive canvas</em>. A
            teacher’s recorded prompts and block manipulations could inhabit the
            same space as student interactions. Then we could string together a
            sequence—or even a dynamic tree—of teacher/student interactions,
            with each recorded prompt reacting to a student’s actions and
            offering further provocation.

            Our versatile canvas doesn’t have to be limited to the number block
            representation we’ve shown. We imagine a future version of this
            canvas that can support all kinds of dynamic representations:
            physics simulations, geometric diagrams, videos, drawings, algebraic
            and numeric symbols, and so on. If we allow these representations to
            connect to each other, students can create and discover ideas we
            didn’t anticipate.

            Just as manipulating our blocks naturally elicits the idea of prime
            numbers, another toy’s contortions might neatly illustrate
            fractions. Taken together, these toys can create authentic
